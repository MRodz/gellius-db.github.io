# What gellius-db is

With the _commentarii_ being sampled and written down, as Gellius himself claims, without any specific order, finding a _commentarius_ that deals with a certain topic can be challenging. Although Gellius thought of his audience and provides a _caput_ for each unit, they don't always tell the whole truth: Oftentimes there is more to a _commentarius_ than its _caput_ claims.

This is where gellius-db comes in.

gellius-db aims to provide an effortless approach to Aulus Gellius' _Noctes Atticae_ for scholars by scholars. The two major aspects of gellius-db are this **website** that offers multiple ways of querying the work and the corresponding **RDF objects in [Wikidata](www.wikidata.org)**.

With gellius-db you can query all available _commentarii_ according to the following facets:

- topics,
- persons mentioned,
- places mentioned,
- where and when the _commentarius_ takes places,
- quotes from other works,
- ... or a combination of all these.

The edition used for this work is @@@.

# What gellius-db is not

Due to copyright restrictions gellius-db **cannot offer a full text** for the _Noctes Atticae_; it should be used in as @Hilfsmittel@ in combination with the printed edition.

Since all _commentarii_ exist as an item in [Wikidata](www.wikidata.org), they are licensed with [CC-0](@@) and can be modified by anyone. Therefore gellius-db **cannot guarantee the correctness** of the data provided; Researchers using gellius-db should check against the text and [improve the data](../contribute/) when they have encountered an error.
