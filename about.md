# What gellius-db is

With the _commentarii_ being sampled and written down, as Gellius himself claims, without any specific order, finding a _commentarius_ that deals with a certain topic can be challenging. Although Gellius thought of his audience and provides a _caput_ for each unit, they don't always tell the whole truth: Oftentimes there is more to a _commentarius_ than its _caput_ claims.

This is where gellius-db comes in.

gellius-db aims to provide an effortless approach to Aulus Gellius' _Noctes Atticae_ for scholars by scholars. The two major aspects of gellius-db are its **website** that offers multiple ways of querying the work and the corresponding **RDF objects in wikidata**.
